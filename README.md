# clingybot
A discord bot that you can use to set up reminders for yourself that will ping you at set intervals before your task. To add this bot to your own server, use the link below:

https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1246642711428202557 

Set reminders in the form of:

r *task*, *date* (either abbreviated form of a day of the week or MM/DD/YY), *time of day* 

Examples:

r take out the trash, mon, 4:30pm 

r vacuum, 8/11/24, 11 (If no am or pm is given, it will default to am if the hour value is under 8 and pm if it's over)

Use ! to see all ongoing reminders.

The bot token is not included in the code, so DM me at deedle#4178 if you want it for some reason
